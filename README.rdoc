# Mission Statement

FoodFeels is an application designed to make it easier to keep track of what you are eating and to help you find potential food intolerances. Traditional pen and paper food diaries are time-consuming to keep and it can be difficult to remember to keep them faithfully. FoodFeels is mobile optimized and sends you reminders when you forget to enter information! FoodFeels also charts your symptoms for you over time, so you can more easily identify potentially problematic foods.
