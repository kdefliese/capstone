My capstone project is an app that is a food and symptom tracker which aims to help people discover or manage potential food intolerances. Keeping a manual food diary can be time-consuming/hard to remember, and most existing food tracker type apps are aimed at meal planning for known dietary intolerances or for weight loss. Creating an app would provide a consumer with a portable and discreet food/symptom diary which could point out potential problem ingredients, show symptom information over time, and send notifications to users if they forget to enter food for the day.
